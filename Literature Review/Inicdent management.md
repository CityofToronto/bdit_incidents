# Intelligent Transportation Systems for Incident Management
*U.S. Department of Transportation*

This report analyses various approaches to incident management undertaken by cities across the United States and summarizes their effectiveness. In the context of BDIT's incident analysis, we are mostly concerned with the impact of freeway service patrol programs on incident clearance times. The City of Toronto already has a well developed indicent detection program on its expressways. As such, this report review will focus exclusively on that aspect of incident management.

## Cities Implementing FSP

The dollar-value of benefit of these entries was determined by analyzing the reduction in vehicle-hours of travel after FSP programs were implemented. A rate of $10/vehicle-hour was [used](http://www.itsbenefits.its.dot.gov/its/benecost.nsf/0/BE1E4488FF0F3E5B852569610051E29F). It is important to note that many of these studies were performed in the 1990s.
